# 🫀 Heart Attack Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and prevention can significantly reduce the risk and severity of heart attacks. This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system that predicts the risk of a heart attack based on key health indicators.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains important medical features such as:
- Age
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting ECG results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression (oldpeak)
- Other heart-related measurements

Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and shuffling for unbiased training.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

We applied and compared the performance of:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## 📈 Results and Insights

The results showed that both models performed well in identifying patients at risk of heart attack. Visualizations such as confusion matrices and accuracy comparisons were created to better interpret the results.

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate how machine learning can be used in the healthcare domain to build predictive models that assist in early disease detection and risk assessment.
